# cgap-docker
Docker Components for CGAP. For now, this consists of a single Dockerfile that will provision the application back-end. This component can be invoked to run commands on the back-end resources of any CGAP environment without interacting with the main application (Beanstalk). This repo at this time only requires Docker to be installed on the machine.
